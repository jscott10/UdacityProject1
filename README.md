# UdacityProject1
Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree - Project 1

REV 2: CORRECTED PER SECOND CODE REVIEW. ADDED MODALS TO PROJECT (TRIGGERED BY PROJECT LINKS).

CORRECTED PER CODE REIVEW. ADDED SRCSET ATTRIBUTES TO IMAGES.

Greetings!

Just a few things to note:

I used Bootstrap (compiled version linked from the CDN, no mods).
The largest size (min-width: 1200px) matches the mockup.
At smaller widths I tried to get a little creative, minor changes to font sizes, weights and element spacing.

Thanks!

Jim Scott
